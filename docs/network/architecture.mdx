import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

In its life cycle, an Etherlink transaction goes through three distinct types of nodes, each responsible for different aspects of Etherlink's features.
These three nodes are being developed as part of the [Octez software suite](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/tezos.html):

- EVM nodes (`octez-evm-node`): The EVM nodes maintain a local copy of the Etherlink context, apply new blocks as they are created, and expose a [JSON RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) compliant endpoint for clients to submit transactions to.
When they receive a transaction, they forward it to their parent EVM node, which forwards it to its parent, and so on until it reaches the sequencer.
- Smart Rollup nodes (`octez-smart-rollup-node`): Smart Rollup nodes run the  Etherlink kernel and monitor Tezos layer 1 for updates to the Etherlink state.
The EVM nodes use internal technical information from these nodes but do not interact with them directly.
For more information about Smart Rollup nodes in general, see [Smart Rollups](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/smart-rollups) on docs.tezos.com.
- Tezos layer 1 nodes (`octez-node`): The layer 1 nodes publish the Etherlink state as part of the Smart Rollup inbox.
The Smart Rollup nodes get information from layer 1 nodes and react to what happens on the Tezos network and on Etherlink.

The Etherlink ecosystem also includes the sequencer, which is solely responsible for creating Etherlink blocks, publishing them to layer 1, and sending them to EVM nodes.

This diagram summarizes the interaction between the nodes:

## Transaction lifecycle

The overall lifecycle of a typical operation is as follows:

1. A user submits a transaction to an EVM node.
1. The EVM node forwards the transaction in a hierarchy to their parent EVM nodes until it reaches Etherlink's sequencer
1. The sequencer includes the transaction in a new block as soon as possible (less than 500ms after receiving it in a nominal scenario).
1. The sequencer publishes the new Etherlink block (known as a blueprint) to layer 1.
1. The sequencer also shares the new blueprint with the EVM nodes for them to update their states.
1. The Smart Rollup nodes tracking the state of Etherlink fetch this new Etherlink block from layer 1 and validate it.
1. Validation from the Smart Rollup nodes allow the EVM nodes to assert that block has been faithfully posted by the sequencer.
