title: The transaction life cycle

import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

In its life cycle, an Etherlink transaction goes through three distinct types of nodes, each responsible for different aspects of Etherlink's features.
These three nodes are being developed as part of the [Octez software suite](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/tezos.html):

- Etherlink nodes (`octez-evm-node`): The Etherlink nodes themselves maintain a local copy of the Etherlink context, apply new blocks as they are created, and expose a [JSON RPC API](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/) compliant endpoint to clients.
- Smart Rollup nodes (`octez-smart-rollup-node`): Etherlink nodes delegate interactions with Tezos layer 1 nodes through these Smart Rollup nodes.
- Tezos layer 1 nodes (`octez-node`): The Smart Rollup nodes listen to Tezos layer 1 nodes and react to what happens on the Tezos network.

The overall lifecycle of a typical operation is as follows:

1. A user submits a transaction to an Etherlink node.
1. The Etherlink node forwards the transaction to Etherlink's sequencer, which includes it in a new block as soon as possible (less than 500ms after receiving it in a nominal scenario).
1. The sequencer forwards the new block to the Smart Rollup node it is connected to.
1. The sequencer also shares the new block available with other Etherlink nodes, which continue to share it in a peer-to-peer manner.
1. The Smart Rollup nodes tracking the state of Etherlink fetch this new Etherlink block and validate it.
1. Validation from the Smart Rollup nodes allow the Etherlink nodes to assert that block has been faithfully posted by the sequencer.
1. Eventually, the Smart Rollup nodes assuming the role of "operators" commit the state of Etherlink to the Tezos network via the layer 1 nodes.

This diagram summarizes the interaction between the nodes:
