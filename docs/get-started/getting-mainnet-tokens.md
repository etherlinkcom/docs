title: Getting and exchanging Mainnet tokens
---

The native coin on Etherlink has the symbol XTZ, similar to but separate from the [tez tokens on Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens).
For more information about that token and the tokens that are available on Etherlink, see [Tokens](/building-on-etherlink/tokens).

## Getting Mainnet XTZ

To get Etherlink Mainnet XTZ, you can:

- Buy or swap for it on [exchanges](/tools/exchanges)

- Use [on-ramps](/tools/onramps) to buy it with fiat currency

:::note

On exchanges, be sure that you are getting Etherlink XTZ and not Tezos layer 1 XTZ or wrapped XTZ (WXTZ) on another platform.
If you have XTZ on a different platform, you can bridge it to Etherlink XTZ as described in [Bridging](/bridging)
