title: Buying and selling Mainnet tokens
---

The native coin on Etherlink has the symbol XTZ, like the [tez tokens on Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens).
For more information about that token and the tokens that are available on Etherlink, see [Tokens](/building-on-etherlink/tokens).

When you are ready to get or sell tokens on Etherlink Mainnet, you have these options:

- Swap other currency for Etherlink XTZ and back on [exchanges](/tools/exchanges)

- Bridge tokens from other chains and back as described in [Bridging](/bridging)

- Use [on-ramps](/tools/onramps) to buy or sell tokens for fiat currency
