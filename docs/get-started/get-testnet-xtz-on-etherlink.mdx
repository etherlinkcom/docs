:::note Bridging from Tezos L1

If you have tez (XTZ) on the Tezos Ghostnet network or get some from the [Ghostnet Faucet](https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/), you can bridge them to Etherlink XTZ by using the bridge at https://bridge.etherlink-nightly.tzalpha.net/.

Follow these steps to connect MetaMask and get XTZ tokens that you can use to pay transaction fees on Etherlink Testnet:

1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) in your browser.

1. Go to [etherlink.com](https://www.etherlink.com/).

1. At the top of the page, click **Faucet**.

1. Under "Get test XTZ on Etherlink," click **Switch Network** and approve the request to add a network and switch networks in MetaMask.
