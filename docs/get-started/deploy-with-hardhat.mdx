title: '👷 Deploy to Etherlink with Hardhat'
---

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is a suite of tools for working with Ethereum contracts and dApps.
You can use Hardhat to deploy contracts to Etherlink just like you use it on other networks:

1. Set up a new Hardhat project by running `npx hardhat init`.
1. Add Etherlink as a network by putting the Etherlink RPC node and your private key in the `hardhat.config.js` file, as in this example:

   ```javascript
   import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

   const config = {
     solidity: "0.8.19",
     networks: {
       etherlinkTest: {
         url: "https://node.ghostnet.etherlink.com",
         accounts: [MY_PRIVATE_KEY],
       }
     }
   };

   export default config;
   ```

1. Create a contract or use the default contract in the `contracts` folder.
1. Compile the contract by running `npx hardhat compile`.
1. Update the default `scripts/deploy.js` file to deploy your contract.
For example, if your contract is named "MyContract.sol" and accepts a string value and an integer value in the constructor, the deployment script looks like this example:

   ```javascript
   import { ethers } from "hardhat";

   async function deployMyContract() {
     const deployedContract = await ethers.deployContract("MyContract", ["Hello", 5]);
     await deployedContract.waitForDeployment();
   }

   deployMyContract().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

1. Run the deployment script on the Etherlink network with this command:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run --network etherlinkTest scripts/deploy.js
   ```

   This command refers to the `etherlinkTest` network in the Hardhat config file.

1. Copy the address of the deployed contract from the log.

Now you can interact with the contract from Hardhat.
For example, if the contract has a function named "DoSomething," you can call it with this code:

   ```javascript
   import { ethers } from "hardhat";

   async function callMyContract() {
     const MyContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("MyContract");
     const contract = MyContract.attach(
       // The deployed contract address
       "0xcDd461a8dD3d519111Fe7a4ac2b9563AcEbF5B7c"
     );

     await contract.DoSomething();
   }

   callMyContract().catch((error) => {
     console.error(error);
     process.exitCode = 1;
   });
   ```

Then you can run this script on the Etherlink network with the command `npx hardhat run --network etherlinkTest scripts/myScript.js`.
