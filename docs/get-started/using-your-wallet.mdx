## Which wallets can I use?

You can connect any wallet that supports custom EVM networks:
- [Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/).
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/learn/wallet/How-to-add-custom-networks-Coinbase-Wallet#:~:text=With%20Coinbase%20Wallet%2C%20EVM%2Dcompatible,added%20as%20a%20custom%20network.)
- [Trust Wallet](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-add-a-custom-network-on-the-trust-wallet-mobile-app/626781)
- [Altme wallet](https://altme.io/)
- [Rabby wallet](https://rabby.io/)

You can use these buttons to connect your wallet to Etherlink:

<table class="customTableContainer">
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Mainnet</th>
        <th>Testnet</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
 <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><WalletConnectButton network="mainnet" title="Connect to Etherlink Mainnet"/></td>
      <td><WalletConnectButton network="testnet" title="Connect to Etherlink Testnet"/></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Your wallet may show warnings about connecting to this site (https://docs.etherlink.com) because it is not a popular source of Etherlink transactions and is not listed on community platforms.
These warnings appear because this documentation site does not handle any transactions, only these wallet connection buttons.
If you want to be sure that you are connecting to the correct network, you can connect to Etherlink on another Etherlink site such as [the faucet](https://faucet.etherlink.com/) and the [bridge](https://www.etherlinkbridge.com).

## Connecting wallets manually

To connect your wallet manually, use the parameters in [Network information](/get-started/network-information).
