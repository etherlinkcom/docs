## Which wallets can I use?

You can connect any wallet that supports custom EVM networks, including:

- [Altme wallet](https://altme.io/)
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/learn/wallet/How-to-add-custom-networks-Coinbase-Wallet)
- [Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/).
- [Nightly wallet](https://nightly.app)
- [Rabby wallet](https://rabby.io/)
- [Temple wallet](https://www.templewallet.com)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)

You can use these buttons to connect your wallet to Etherlink:

<table class="customTableContainer">
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Mainnet</th>
        <th>Shadownet Testnet</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
 <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><WalletConnectButton network="mainnet" title="Connect to Etherlink Mainnet"/></td>
      <td><WalletConnectButton network="shadownet" title="Connect to Etherlink Shadownet Testnet"/></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Your wallet may show warnings about connecting to this site (https://docs.etherlink.com) because it is not a popular source of Etherlink transactions and is not listed on community platforms.
These warnings appear because this documentation site does not handle any transactions, only these wallet connection buttons.
If you want to be sure that you are connecting to the correct network, you can connect to Etherlink on another Etherlink site such as these:

To connect to Etherlink Mainnet, use the [Mainnet block explorer](https://explorer.etherlink.com/) or the [bridge](https://www.etherlinkbridge.com).

To connect to Etherlink Shadownet Testnet, use the [Shadownet Testnet block explorer](https://shadownet.explorer.etherlink.com/) or the [faucet](https://shadownet.faucet.etherlink.com/).

## Connecting wallets manually

To connect your wallet manually, use the parameters in [Network information](/get-started/network-information).
