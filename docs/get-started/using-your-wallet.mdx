## Which wallets can I use?

You can connect any wallet that supports custom EVM networks:
- [Metamask](https://support.metamask.io/networks-and-sidechains/managing-networks/how-to-add-a-custom-network-rpc/).
- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/learn/wallet/How-to-add-custom-networks-Coinbase-Wallet#:~:text=With%20Coinbase%20Wallet%2C%20EVM%2Dcompatible,added%20as%20a%20custom%20network.)
- [Trust Wallet](https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-add-a-custom-network-on-the-trust-wallet-mobile-app/626781)

The easiest way to connect your MetaMask wallet to Etherlink is to go to [the faucet](https://faucet.etherlink.com/) and connect as described in [Getting testnet tokens](/get-started/getting-testnet-tokens).

## Connecting wallets manually

To connect your wallet manually, use the parameters in [Network information](./network-information).
