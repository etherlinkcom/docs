title: Getting Testnet tokens
---

The native coin on Etherlink has the symbol XTZ, like the [tez tokens on Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens).
For more information about that token and the tokens that are available on Etherlink, see [Tokens](/building-on-etherlink/tokens).

The Etherlink test network has a faucet that provides free XTZ tokens that you can use to pay transaction fees and test applications on Etherlink.

To get tokens on Etherlink Ghostnet Testnet (or Etherlink Shadownet Testnet), follow these steps:

1. Go to [faucet.etherlink.com](https://faucet.etherlink.com/) (respectively, [shadownet.faucet.etherlink.com](https://shadownet.faucet.etherlink.com)).
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet.
3. Under "Get testnet XTZ on Etherlink," click **Switch Network** and approve the request to add and switch networks in your wallet.
4. Solve the CAPTCHA if it appears.
5. In the table of tokens, next to the token that you want, click **Send**.
6. Wait until the button shows that the tokens have been transferred.

The tokens appear in your wallet immediately.
If you don't see them, you may need to click **Add to Wallet** next to the **Send** button.

:::tip

The faucet provides a fixed amount of tokens once every 24 hours.
If you need more tokens, the faucet provides more XTZ.
Then you can bridge the XTZ to Etherlink with the bridge, as described in [Bridging tokens](/bridging).
