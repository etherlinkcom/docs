title: Getting testnet tokens
---

The native coin on Etherlink has the symbol XTZ, like the [tez tokens on Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens).
For more information about that token and the tokens that are available on Etherlink, see [Tokens](/building-on-etherlink/tokens).

The Etherlink test network has a faucet that provides free XTZ tokens that you can use to pay transaction fees and test applications on Etherlink.

To get XTZ on Etherlink Testnet, follow these steps:

1. Go to [faucet.etherlink.com](https://faucet.etherlink.com/).
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet.
3. Under "Get testnet XTZ on Etherlink," click **Switch Network** and approve the request to add and switch networks in your wallet.
4. Solve the CAPTCHA.
5. Click **Send 1 XTZ**.
6. Wait until the button shows that the XTZ tokens have been transferred.

You can also get testnet XTZ on the [Tezos testnet faucet](https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/) and bridge them to Etherlink Testnet.
For information about bridging, see [Bridging tokens](/bridging).
