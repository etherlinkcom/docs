To get tez on Etherlink testnet, follow these steps:

1. Go to [faucet.etherlink.com](https://faucet.etherlink.com/).
2. Connect your Ethereum wallet.
3. Under "Get testnet XTZ on Etherlink," click **Switch Network** and approve the request to add and switch networks in your wallet.
4. Solve the CAPTCHA.
5. Click **Send 1 XTZ**.
