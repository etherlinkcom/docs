title: Using the chatbot
---

The AI-powered chatbot on this website (and a few websites in the tezos.com domain) is a conversational agent answering questions in plain English, based on the documentation (see [documentation sources](#documentation-sources)).

You can access the chatbot with the **Ask AI** button at the center right of the page.

Here are a few instructions & caveats that may help you better understand what you can expect from the chatbot (and what not to).

:::note

Note that the chatbot is in Beta testing. You may provide feedback on it using the thumb up/down in its box, or comments via the **Feedback** button at the bottom right of the page.

:::warning

The answers of the chatbot may be wrong, so you should use them wisely.

The chatbot is **optimized for searching documentation**: searching and corroborating existing pieces of information in the documentation and pointing to the relevant sources.
In this respect, it serves as a documentation search assistant, to locate relevant pages in a big information base, even if the questions may not use exactly the right terms and keywords.

Note that this searching feature of the chatbot is complementary to the classic search engine that is still provided:
- Classic search is meant to show you **all** the pages that contain some precise keywords (modulo some spelling variations), which is helpful when you know what terms to search for.
- In comparison, the chatbot is **not** meant for exhaustive results, but is better in interpreting questions, finding related terms, and guiding you to pages with information that may be helpful.

While the chatbot also attempts to answer more general questions about Tezos and the tools and processes in the ecosystem, **it may occasionally suggest incorrect commands or even explain notions that do not exist**.

In particular, **the chatbot is NOT a coding assistant**. It is not recommended to ask it for code excerpts or examples. Use with caution any code suggested by it.

As a rule of thumb, the chatbot is more reliable in questions of the form "**What is** X?" than "**How to** do Y" or "**Why is** Z"?
While it may provide useful and valuable information for the latter forms, interpret and use the answers with care.

## Documentation sources

The chatbot and AI-powered search currently use the following documentation sources:

- The Etherlink documentation (https://docs.etherlink.com/)
- The Tezos documentation (https://docs.tezos.com/)
- The Octez & Protocol documentation (https://octez.tezos.com/)
- The LIGO documentation (https://ligo.tezos.com/)
- The SmartPy documentation (https://smartpy.tezos.com/)

We may add later on other companion websites from the [Tezos documentation ecosystem](https://docs.tezos.com/overview/resources).
