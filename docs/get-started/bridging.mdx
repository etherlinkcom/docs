title: Bridging tokens

import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

You can move tokens from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1 and back through a process called _bridging_.
Currently you can bridge the native token on Etherlink and Tezos, which is called tez and shown on price tickers with the symbol [XTZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/).
For more information about tez, see [Tokens](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens) on docs.tezos.com.

Etherlink and Tezos each have main networks called Mainnet and test networks called Ghostnet.
Ghostnet is a synonym for Testnet in the Ethereum world; it allows developers to test their software in a risk-free sandbox environment.
You can bridge tez from Tezos Mainnet to Etherlink Mainnet and back, and you can bridge tez from Tezos Ghostnet to Etherlink Ghostnet and back.

:::note Bridging time
Tokens that you bridge from Tezos to Etherlink are available for use on Etherlink immediately.

Tokens that you bridge from Etherlink to Tezos are available for use on Tezos in two weeks.

This delay is caused by the [Smart Rollup refutation period](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/smart-rollups#refutation-periods).
As with all Smart Rollups, Etherlink nodes post commitments about their state to Tezos layer 1, including incoming bridging transactions, on a regular schedule.
Other nodes have the length of the refutation period (14 days) to challenge those commitments.
At the end of the refutation period, the correct commitment is _cemented_, or made final and unchangeable.
The Etherlink indexer run by Nomadic Labs automatically executes these bridging transactions when they are cemented, which makes the bridged tokens available on Tezos.

## How bridging works

The bridging process uses two contracts, an EVM bridging contract that stores information about how many tokens different accounts have bridged and an exchanger contract that stores the tokens and issues tickets that represent those tokens.

1. A user sends a request to the Etherlink's EVM bridge contract's "deposit" entrypoint.
The request includes the tez to bridge, the address of the Etherlink Smart Rollup, and the user's Etherlink wallet address.
1. The EVM bridge contract sends the tez in a transaction to the exchanger contract's "mint" entrypoint.
1. The exchanger contract stores the tez and creates a [ticket](https://docs.tezos.com/smart-contracts/data-types/complex-data-types#tickets) that represents the receipt of the tokens.
1. The exchanger contract sends the ticket to the EVM bridge contract.
1. The bridge contract forwards the ticket to the Etherlink Smart Rollup, which mints the appropriate Etherlink tokens and sends them to the address based on the ticket.

## Bridging tokens on Mainnet

To bridge tez from Tezos Mainnet to Etherlink Mainnet and back, use the [Mainnet canonical bridge](https://bridge.etherlink.com/).
The bridge uses these general steps:

1. Connect your Tezos and Etherlink-compatible wallets.
1. Select the type of transfer:

   - **Deposit** transfers tez from Tezos layer 1 to Etherlink
   - **Withdraw** transfers tez from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1

1. Enter the amount of tez to transfer.

1. Click **Move funds to Etherlink** or **Move funds to Tezos**.

You can monitor the status of your bridge operations on the **Transaction History** tab.

## Bridging tokens on Ghostnet

You can get Ghostnet tez from the [Ghostnet Faucet](https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/).

Then you can use the [Testnet canonical bridge](https://bridge-xi.vercel.app/) to bridge those tokens to Etherlink or bridge tokens from Etherlink to Tezos.
