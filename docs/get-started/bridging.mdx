import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

You can move tokens from Etherlink to Tezos and back through a process called _bridging_.
Currently you can bridge the native token on Etherlink and Tezos, which is called tez and shown on price tickers with the symbol [XTZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/).
For more information about tez, see [Tokens](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens) on docs.tezos.com.

## Bridging from Tezos L1

You can bridge XTZ from Tezos Mainnet or Ghostnet.

:::info Tezos Ghostnet
Tezos has two networks, **Mainnet** and **Ghostnet**. Ghostnet is a synonym for Testnet in the Ethereum world, and allows developers to test their software in a risk-free sandbox environment.
:::

### Mainnet

You can use the [Mainnet canonical bridge](https://bridge.etherlink.com/) to bridge to Etherlink Mainnet.

Simply connect your Tezos and Etherlink compatible wallets, enter how much XTZ you want to transfer, and bridge!

### Ghostnet

You can get Ghostnet XTZ from the [Ghostnet Faucet](https://faucet.ghostnet.teztnets.com/). Once you have some XTZ, you can then use the [Testnet canonical bridge](https://bridge-xi.vercel.app/) to bridge to Etherlink Testnet.

Simply connect your Tezos wallet, enter your Etherlink wallet address and the amount of XTZ you want to transfer, and bridge!
