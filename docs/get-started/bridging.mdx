title: Bridging tokens
---

import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

You can move tokens from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1 and back through a process called _bridging_.
Currently you can bridge the native token on Etherlink and Tezos, which is called tez and shown on price tickers with the symbol [XTZ](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tezos/).
For more information about tez, see [Tokens](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens) on docs.tezos.com.

Etherlink and Tezos each have main networks called Mainnet and test networks called Ghostnet.
Ghostnet is a synonym for Testnet in the Ethereum world; it allows developers to test their software in a risk-free sandbox environment.
You can bridge tez from Tezos Mainnet to Etherlink Mainnet and back, and you can bridge tez from Tezos Ghostnet to Etherlink Ghostnet and back.

:::note Bridging time
Tokens that you bridge from Tezos to Etherlink are available for use on Etherlink immediately.

Tokens that you bridge from Etherlink to Tezos are available for use on Tezos in two weeks.

This delay is caused by the [Smart Rollup refutation period](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/smart-rollups#refutation-periods).
As with all Smart Rollups, Etherlink nodes post commitments about their state to Tezos layer 1, including incoming bridging transactions, on a regular schedule.
Other nodes have the length of the refutation period (14 days) to challenge those commitments.
At the end of the refutation period, the correct commitment is _cemented_, or made final and unchangeable.
The Etherlink indexer run by Nomadic Labs automatically executes these bridging transactions when they are cemented, which makes the bridged tokens available on Tezos.

## Bridging your tokens

Etherlink provides bridges for tez tokens:

- [Mainnet canonical bridge](https://bridge.etherlink.com/)
- [Testnet canonical bridge](https://bridge-xi.vercel.app/)

The bridges use these general steps:

1. Connect your Tezos and Etherlink-compatible wallets.
1. Select the type of transfer:

   - **Deposit** transfers tez from Tezos layer 1 to Etherlink
   - **Withdraw** transfers tez from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1

1. Enter the amount of tez to transfer.

1. Click **Move funds to Etherlink** or **Move funds to Tezos**.

You can monitor the status of your bridge operations on the **Transaction History** tab.

## How bridging works

The bridging process uses two contracts on Tezos layer 1:

- A bridge contract that accepts deposits and sends them to be exchanged.

  - The source code of this contract is in [`evm_bridge.mligo`](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/etherlink/tezos_contracts/evm_bridge.mligo).
  - This contract is deployed to Ghostnet at [`KT1VEjeQfDBSfpDH5WeBM5LukHPGM2htYEh3`](https://ghostnet.tzkt.io/KT1VEjeQfDBSfpDH5WeBM5LukHPGM2htYEh3/).
  - This contract is deployed to Mainnet at [`KT1Wj8SUGmnEPFqyahHAcjcNQwe6YGhEXJb5`](https://tzkt.io/KT1Wj8SUGmnEPFqyahHAcjcNQwe6YGhEXJb5/).
- An exchanger contract that stores the tokens and issues tickets that represent those tokens.

  - The source code of this contract is in [`evm_bridge.mligo`](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/master/etherlink/tezos_contracts/exchanger.mligo).
  - This contract is deployed to Ghostnet at [`KT1VEjeQfDBSfpDH5WeBM5LukHPGM2htYEh3`](https://ghostnet.tzkt.io/KT1VEjeQfDBSfpDH5WeBM5LukHPGM2htYEh3/).

1. A user sends a request to the bridge contract's `deposit` entrypoint.
The request includes the tez to bridge, the address of the Etherlink Smart Rollup, and the user's Etherlink wallet address.
1. The bridge contract stores the address of the Etherlink Smart Rollup temporarily.
1. It sends the tez in a transaction to the exchanger contract's `mint` entrypoint.
1. The exchanger contract stores the tez and creates a [ticket](https://docs.tezos.com/smart-contracts/data-types/complex-data-types#tickets) that represents the receipt of the tokens.
1. The exchanger contract sends the ticket to the bridge contract's `callback` entrypoint.
1. The bridge contract forwards the ticket to the stored Etherlink Smart Rollup address and clears its storage for the next transfer.
1. The Etherlink Smart Rollup uses the information in the ticket to mint tokens on Etherlink and send them to the user's Etherlink address.
