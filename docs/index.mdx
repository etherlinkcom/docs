import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible, non-custodial Layer 2 blockchain powered by Tezos Smart Rollup technology.
It supports Ethereum's ecosystem tools, including wallets and indexers, facilitating seamless integration and the capability to transfer assets to and from other EVM-compatible chains.

Built upon the secure foundation of Tezos layer 1, Etherlink delivers a fast, fair, and (nearly) free experience.
This permissionless and censorship-resistant environment empowers developers to build and participate in the next generation of decentralized applications.

### It's fast

Etherlink is low latency, with sub-second (< 500ms) confirmation times, delivered by the sequencer.
The Tezos 2-block finality guarantee and the speed of its Smart Rollups ensure that transactions are finalized quickly.

Chain | L2 finality time | Data posted on L1
--- | --- | ---
Etherlink | ~ 500ms | ~ 15 seconds
Optimism Bedrock | ~ [2 seconds](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#blocks) | ~ [2 minutes](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/batches)
Arbitrum One | ~ [300 ms](https://arbiscan.io/) | ~ [7 minutes](https://arbiscan.io/batches)

### It's fair

Etherlink's governance process promotes transparency and fairness in decision-making.
Tezos token holders can participate in proposing and voting on changes to the protocol with no administrative keys; users retain complete control, keeping their assets free from custodial control and abuse.

A permissionless and robust fraud-proof system fully integrated into the Tezos protocol ensures network integrity.
Out-of-the-box, anyone can participate and run an operator, challenge, post commitments, and contribute to securing the network's state.

### It's (nearly) free

An ERC-20 transaction costs $0.001 or less on Etherlink.
At only a fraction of a cent, Etherlink fees are as low as it gets, enabling cost-effective transactions and opening the doors to innovation.
Etherlink is built on Tezos Smart Rollups, which are enshrined on the platform, meaning they are implemented directly on layer 1 of the protocol.
However, because Smart Rollups run in separate environments, they are not subject to the per-transaction gas fees of layer 1, only small fees when they publish their state to layer 1.
