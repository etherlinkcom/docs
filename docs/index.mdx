Etherlink is an EVM-compatible layer-2 blockchain powered by [Tezos Smart Rollup](https://tezos.com/developers/smart-rollups/) technology.

### It's fast

**Etherlink has sub-second block confiration times for a snappy experience**. Tezos' 2-block finality guarantee and the speed of its Smart Rollups ensure that transactions are finalized quickly.

### It's cheap

**An ERC-20 transaction costs \$0.01 or less on Etherlink**. Etherlink is built on Tezos Smart Rollups, which are enshrined on the platform, meaning that they are implemented directly on layer 1 of the protocol. However, because Smart Rollups run in their own separate environments, they are not subject to the per-transaction gas fees of layer 1, only small fees when they publish their state to layer 1.
