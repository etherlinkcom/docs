title: Bridging tokens between Etherlink and other EVM networks
---

import InlineCopy from '@site/src/components/InlineCopy';

[The Etherlink EVM bridge](https://www.etherlinkbridge.com/) is a web application that allows you to transfer wrapped tokens between [Etherlink](https://www.etherlink.com/) and several other EVM compatible blockchain networks by interacting with the decentralized smart contracts of [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) deployed on each of those networks. The EVM bridge supports connections from Etherlink to **Ethereum**, **Avalanche C-Chain**, **Arbitrum One**, **Optimism**, **Base**, and **Binance Smart Chain**. You can transfer several wrapped tokens, including **ETH**, **USDT**, **USDC**, **WBTC**, **AVAX**, **SHIB**, and **BNB**.

This guide explains how to bridge tokens with the Etherlink EVM bridge, including selecting the source chain, choosing the token to transfer, entering the number of tokens and transferring the tokens. It also covers troubleshooting issues that may arise during the transfer process.

The token addresses on each network are listed [at the end of this guide](#etherlinkbridge-token-addresses) for your reference.

## Using the wrapped asset bridge

### 1. Go to the Bridge and Connect your Wallet
Go to the Etherlink wrapped asset bridge at https://www.etherlinkbridge.com/bridge. Once on the EtherlinkBridge interface, click the **Connect** button and connect your EVM wallet.

### 2. Select the Source Chain
You should select the source chain from which you want to bridge a token into Etherlink. To send tokens out of Etherlink, select Etherlink as the source chain.

### 3. Select the Token to Transfer
Click **"Select Token"** to choose a token to transfer from the source chain, or alternatively, leave to the default source token. The interface will display all bridgeable tokens across all available networks as well as your token balances.

### 4. Select the Amount of Tokens
Enter the number of tokens you want to bridge from the source chain. The app will display:
- The amount of bridged tokens you will receive on the destination chain
- The necessary fees for the token transfer in the native gas token of the source chain. **Ensure you have enough gas tokens on the source chain to pay the fees**

:::note Gas on Destination
Interacting with Etherlink requires **XTZ** ownership to pay for gas fees. When bridging to Etherlink, you can set an airdrop of up to **0.1 XTZ** to your Etherlink wallet address as part of the bridge transfer. This will be added to the total fees you pay for the transfer and enable you to have the necessary gas in Etherlink to start your journey and interact with the ecosystem. By default, the bridge will add 0.1 XTZ "Gas on Destination" if you don't have any XTZ in your wallet. You can also click the highlighted amount of XTZ or "add", in which case a popup will open that lets you define how much XTZ you want to receive. Either use the "Max" setting, which gives you 0.1 XTZ, or specify a custom amount of up to 0.1 XTZ.
:::

### 5. Transfer the Tokens
- Click **"Transfer"**. Your wallet will ask you to approve the token spending and confirm the transaction
- After your confirmation, a popup will appear; if you click on the link provided, you will be forwarded to [LayerZero Scan](https://layerzeroscan.com/) to observe the detailed progress of your bridge interaction
- The bridge will also display the progress of your transaction, including an estimated period till the bridging is completed in the "transactions" box that appears after confirmation
- Once the status changes to "completed", your tokens have arrived in your wallet
- Please make sure you have imported the correct token into your wallet on the destination chain to see it

## Troubleshooting

Conditions that will hinder your transfer will be indicated in the "Action button" as follows:

### Insufficient Balance
- You entered a higher amount of tokens than you hold in your account.
    - Reduce the amount you want to transfer or add more tokens to your wallet.

### Not Enough Native for Gas
- You must own more gas on the source chain to pay the required fees.
    - You need to send more of the source chain's native gas token to your wallet to resolve this.

### Select Different Chain
- You have selected an incompatible selection of source and destination chain. It is only possible to bridge in and out of Etherlink with EtherlinkBridge; you cannot send from ETH to Avalanche, for example.
    - Send either tokens into Etherlink or send them from Etherlink out to another chain.

### Limit Exceeded
- This can occur for bridgeable tokens that exist on several networks (ETH/WETH, USDT and USDC).
- These tokens can enter Etherlink from different source chains but are represented as one token on Etherlink. If you aim to send these tokens out of Etherlink, the LayerZero contracts on each chain can only payout the amount of these tokens that are currently locked in the contract, so you cannot send more assets back than currently are available to release. This would otherwise exceed the limits of that contract.

#### Example
- On Ethereum, 100 USDT are locked in the Bridge contract (from users that did send this USDT from ETH to Etherlink)
- On Avalanche, also 100 USDT are locked in the Bridge contract (from users that did send this USDT from Avalanche to Etherlink)
- You hold 150 USDT in your Wallet on Etherlink
- If you try to send this 150 USDT to Avalanche, it will exceed the amount currently locked in the Avalanche USDT Bridge contract; therefore, you can't execute such a transfer.
- **Reduce the amount you attempt to send until it is below the Limit.**

<!-- ## How bridging wrapped assets works

The Etherlink wrapped asset bridge uses a [wrapped asset bridge](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/wrapped-asset-bridge) created by [LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/).
It works by maintaining pools on each side of the bridge.

When you bridge tokens, it locks the tokens on the source network, sends a message over LayerZero's software to the target network, and unlocks wrapped tokens on the target network.

For more information, see the repository for the bridge: https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/wrapped-asset-bridge. -->
