title: Verifying contracts

Verifying a smart contract provides a link to its source code and attests that the source code matches the deployed bytecode.

Follow these steps to verify a contract on the Etherlink block explorer:

1. Find the deployed contract on https://explorer.etherlink.com/, https://testnet.explorer.etherlink.com/, or https://shadownet.explorer.etherlink.com/.

1. On the **Contract** tab, click **Verify & publish**.

1. In the **New smart contract verification** window, select the license and verification method.
In most cases, use the **Solidity (Single file)** verification method.

1. Under "Contract verification via Solidity (flattened source code)", in the **Compiler** field, select the same compiler version that you used to compile the contract.

1. In the **EVM version** field, select the same EVM version that you used to compile the contract.

1. If your compiler optimized the contract source code, select the **Optimization enabled** check box.
This setting must match your compiler's setting.

1. Paste the source code of the contract in the **Contract code** field.

  The page looks like this:

1. Click **Verify & publish**.

Now the block explorer shows the source code and ABI of the contract on the **Contract** tab.
