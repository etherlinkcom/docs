title: Bridging FA tokens between Tezos layer 1 and Etherlink
---

You can bridge tokens that are compliant with FA standards between Tezos layer 1 and Etherlink.

The Tezos FA standards are token standards like the Ethereum ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 standards.
For more information about these standards, see [Token standards](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens#token-standards) on docs.tezos.com.

## Enabling a token for bridging

Before you can bridge an FA-compliant token to Etherlink, you must enable it for bridging by deploying a proxy contract for it on Etherlink and helper contracts on Tezos layer 1.
