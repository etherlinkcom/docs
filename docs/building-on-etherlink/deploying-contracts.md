title: Deploying Solidity contracts
---

As an EVM-compatible chain, Etherlink runs Solidity contracts.
You can deploy Solidity contracts in any way that you would deploy them to an EVM-compatible chain.

:::note

Etherlink supports Solidity versions up to and including 0.8.24.

:::

You can use any of the toolkits in [Development toolkits](./development-toolkits) to deploy to Etherlink, as well as standard tools such as the [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
