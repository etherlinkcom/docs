title: Bridging tokens
---

You can move tokens in and out of Etherlink through a process called _bridging_.
Different bridging processes move different kinds of tokens.
See the following pages for information about the kind of token that you want to bridge:

- [Bridging tez (XTZ) between Tezos layer 1 and Etherlink](./bridging-xtz)
- [Bridging tokens between Etherlink and other EVM networks](./bridging-wrapped-assets) such as Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum One, Optimism, Base, and BNB Chain
- Bridging FA tokens between Tezos layer 1 and Etherlink (coming soon)

## Bridges

Etherlink developers have created bridges for different situations.
These bridges are trustless and permissionless; anyone can use them without restrictions or the intervention of a third party.
