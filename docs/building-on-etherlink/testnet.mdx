Etherlink has two active test networks:

- **Ghostnet Testnet** was the original Etherlink public test network.
It runs on the Tezos Ghostnet test network.

   :::note

   Ghostnet Testnet will be decommissioned soon, so developers should move to Shadownet Testnet.

   :::

- **Shadownet Testnet** is the new Etherlink public test network.
It runs on the Tezos Shadownet test network.
Developers should migrate to this test network.

   Here are some important pieces of information for Shadownet:

   - RPC endpoint: <InlineCopy code="https://node.braeburn.etherlink.com" />
   - Block explorer: <a href="https://testnet.explorer.etherlink.com/">https://testnet.explorer.etherlink.com/</a>
   - Chain ID: 128123

For more technical details about these networks, see [Network information](/get-started/network-information).

For more information about the Tezos test networks that Etherlink test networks run on, see [Testing on testnets](https://docs.tezos.com/developing/testnets) on docs.tezos.com.

## Using test networks

In most cases, you can use a test network in place of Mainnet by using the RPC URL of an EVM node that is running on that test network.
You can use the public RPC node for the network for a small number of transactions (because it has a rate limit), or you can run your own EVM node on the test network by following the instructions in [Running an Etherlink EVM node](/network/evm-nodes).

Then, use the RPC URL in transactions, as in this example, which uses the public RPC node for the Shadownet Testnet:

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://node.braeburn.etherlink.com\
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --header 'content-type: application/json' \
     --data '
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_gasPrice"
}
'
```

Examples of using test networks are on other pages in this documentation.
