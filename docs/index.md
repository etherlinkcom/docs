title: '‚ùì What is Etherlink?'
---

Etherlink is an EVM-compatible chain that has a decentralised sequencer, low gas fees, and fair ordering.

* **Decentralised sequencer üåê:** Using a state-of-the-art consensus mechanism, Etherlink's decentralised sequencer provides high availability and built-in censorship resistance.
* **Very low fees üí∞ :** At a load of 200TPS, expect an ERC-20 transaction to cost $0.01 on Etherlink.
* **Fair ordering ‚öñÔ∏è :** Etherlink's distributed sequencer provides maximal extractable value (MEV, also known as "sandwich attack") protection by running transactions in a fair, first-come-first-serve order for all users.

Etherlink uses Smart Rollups on the decentralised [Tezos](https://tezos.com) protocol for data availability and will expand to use the Tezos [Data Availability Layer](https://spotlight.tezos.com/data-availability-layer-dal-what-is-it-all-about/).

### What does that mean?

* **EVM compatible**: Etherlink runs all Solidity/Vyper smart contracts just like any other EVM chain. All your developer tooling (including [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/), and [Viem](https://viem.sh)) should work out-of-the-box with Etherlink.
* **Smart Rollup**: Smart Rollups are Tezos's permissionless L2 scaling solution. They are WASM applications, providing versatility in what language you write them in. They are optimistic and enshrined:
  * **Optimistic** means that when rollup operators publish a claim about the state of the rollup, the claim is trusted by default. Other operators can easily verify and challenge the claim, and a single honest operator is enough to ensure that the rollup is running honestly.
  * **Enshrined** means that they are implemented as a first-class operation at the protocol level within L1 Tezos, as opposed to using a smart contract on L1 like current Ethereum solutions.
* **Data availability on Tezos**: Smart Rollups store data on Tezos layer 1, making it available to everyone.
