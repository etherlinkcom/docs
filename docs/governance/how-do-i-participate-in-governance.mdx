title: How do I participate in governance?

import InlineCopy from '@site/src/components/InlineCopy';

Tezos bakers can participate in the [Etherlink governance process](/governance/how-is-etherlink-governed) by submitting proposals and voting for them.

The voting power of a baker is the amount of tez that it has staked plus the tez that delegators have delegated to it, also called its _staking balance_.

Separate contracts manage the slow kernel updates, the fast kernel updates, and the sequencer operator, so to interact with them, bakers send transactions to those contracts, such as with the Octez client.
The addresses of the governance contracts are specified in Etherlink's kernel.
For information about the Octez client, see [Command Line Interface](https://octez.tezos.com/docs/active/cli-commands.html) in the Octez documentation.

## Governance contract addresses

You need the address of the correct governance contract (and sometimes the address of the Etherlink Smart Rollup) to propose changes, vote on changes, and trigger approved changes.

## Participating in kernel governance

Bakers can propose, vote on, and trigger kernel updates with these commands.
The commands are the same for slow and fast upgrades but they target different governance contracts.

### Getting information about the current period

You can get information about the current period at https://governance.etherlink.com.

To get information about the current state of either kernel governance contract directly from the contract, connect the Octez client to an active node and call the contract's `get_voting_state` view.
For example, this Octez client command calls this view for the slow governance contract on Mainnet:

```bash
octez-client -E https://mainnet.ecadinfra.com \
  run view get_voting_state on contract KT1VZVNCNnhUp7s15d9RsdycP7C1iwYhAQ8r
```

The view returns information about the current governance period in this order:

- The index of the current period
- Whether the current period is Proposal (`Left Unit`) or Promotion (`Right Unit`)
- The number of blocks remaining in the period
- Information about voting during the period

For example, this response shows that the contract is currently in the Proposal period:

```
(Pair 1619 (Left Unit) 64 None)
```

Block explorers show this information in a more human-readable format.

You can also subscribe to the `voting_finished` event to be notified when the Proposal period completes.

### Delegating your key

For convenience, bakers can delegate their Etherlink voting rights to a key other than their baking key.
This delegation affects only their Etherlink voting rights, not their Tezos layer 1 protocol upgrade voting rights.

Bakers can change their delegation at any time, and delegation changes take effect immediately.

Delegating voting rights is a two-step process:

1. The baking key proposes delegation to a voting key by calling the `propose_voting_key` entrypoint.
1. The voting key claims the delegated voting rights by calling the `claim_voting_rights` entrypoint.

The delegation is not active until both of these steps are complete.

To propose delegation to a voting key, call the `propose_voting_key` entrypoint of the voting rights delegation contract.
By default, when you delegate your baking key to another key, that key receives the rights to vote for all governance contracts.
For example, the following command proposes delegation of voting rights for all governance contract from the key with the alias `my_wallet`.
It uses the variable `<MY_DELEGATE>` in place of the address of the account to delegate to:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Right (Pair \"<MY_DELEGATE>\" True None))" --burn-cap 0.1
```

Then, to claim the delegated voting rights, call the `claim_voting_rights` entrypoint from the delegated key and pass the baking key address.
For example, the following command claims the voting rights proposed in the previous command.
It uses the variable `<MY_BAKER>` in place of the address of the baking key address:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from <MY_DELEGATE> to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Left \"<MY_BAKER>\")" --burn-cap 0.1
```

To remove the delegation and use your baking key to vote as before, propose delegation to the baking key and then claim the rights, as in this example:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from <MY_BAKER> to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Right (Pair \"<MY_BAKER>\" True None))" --burn-cap 0.1

octez-client transfer 0 from <MY_BAKER> to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Left \"<MY_BAKER>\")" --burn-cap 0.1
```

You can also set the governance contracts to delegate rights for by specifying certain governance contracts.
The following example passes `True` and the addresses of the slow kernel governance and sequencer governance contracts as a proposal.
As a result, the delegated key can vote on those contracts but not on the kernel fast governance contract:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from <MY_BAKER> to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Pair \"<MY_DELEGATE>\" True (Some { \"KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf\" ; \"KT1VZVNCNnhUp7s15d9RsdycP7C1iwYhAQ8r\" }))"
```

Then, run this command to claim the voting rights for the specified contracts, which is just like the previous command to claim voting rights:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from <MY_DELEGATE> to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Left \"<MY_BAKER>\")" --burn-cap 0.1
```

The following example passes `False` and the address of the fast kernel governance contract.
The result is the same as the previous proposal example: the delegated key can vote on the slow kernel governance and sequencer governance contracts but not the fast kernel governance contract.
You can also use this proposal to remove delegation for specific contracts:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from <MY_BAKER> to KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  --arg "(Right (Pair \"<MY_DELEGATE>\" False (Some { \"KT1QDgF5pBkXEizj5RnmagEyxLxMTwVRpmYk\" })))" --burn-cap 0.1
```

To check if an address has voting rights for a governance contract, pass the baking account address, the voting account address, and an option containing the governance contracts (or `None` for all contracts) to the `is_voting_key_of` view.
For example, this command verifies that the key represented by the variable `<MY_BAKER>` has not delegated any rights to other accounts:

```bash
octez-client run view is_voting_key_of on contract KT1Ut6kfrTV9tK967tDYgQPMvy9t578iN7iH \
  with input "Pair \"<MY_BAKER>\" \"<MY_BAKER>\" None"
```

### Proposing and upvoting upgrades

During a Proposal period, bakers can propose updates by calling the `new_proposal` entrypoint of the appropriate governance contract and passing the hash of their proposed kernel, as in this example, which uses `<KERNEL_HASH>` as the kernel hash:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1VZVNCNnhUp7s15d9RsdycP7C1iwYhAQ8r \
  --entrypoint "new_proposal" \
  --arg "<KERNEL_HASH>"
```

The command takes these parameters:

- The address or Octez client alias of your baker account or the account to which you have delegated your Etherlink voting rights
- The address of the Etherlink kernel governance contract
- The hash of the upgraded kernel, which the proposer must generate from the code of the new kernel

The proposer must make the code and hash of the new kernel available for people to evaluate.
You can look for this information in blog posts or other announcements from proposal developers.
Proposers can make it easier for bakers to upgrade to the new kernel by providing the preimages for the kernel online so nodes can update from them directly.

To upvote a proposed kernel update during a Proposal period, call the `upvote_proposal` entrypoint with the same parameters:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1VZVNCNnhUp7s15d9RsdycP7C1iwYhAQ8r \
  --entrypoint "upvote_proposal" \
  --arg "<KERNEL_HASH>"
```

It's not necessary to upvote a proposal that you submitted; submitting a proposal implies that your account upvotes it.

### Voting for or against upgrades

When a proposal is in the Promotion period, you can vote for or against it or pass on voting by calling the `vote` entrypoint of the appropriate governance contract:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1VZVNCNnhUp7s15d9RsdycP7C1iwYhAQ8r \
  --entrypoint "vote" --arg '"yea"'
```

The command takes these parameters:

- The address or Octez client alias of your baker account or the account to which you have delegated your Etherlink voting rights
- The address of the Etherlink kernel governance contract
- `"yea"`, `"nay"`, or `"pass"`, including the double quotes

The command does not need the hash of the kernel because only one kernel can be in the Promotion period at a time, so the options are to vote for or against that kernel or to abstain by voting "pass."

### Triggering upgrades

After a proposal wins a vote, any user can trigger the kernel upgrade by calling the appropriate governance contract's `trigger_kernel_upgrade` entrypoint:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1DxndcFitAbxLdJCN3C1pPivqbC3RJxD1R \
  --entrypoint "trigger_kernel_upgrade" \
  --arg '"sr1Ghq66tYK9y3r8CC1Tf8i8m5nxh8nTvZEf"'
```

The command takes these parameters:

- The address or Octez client alias of your account
- The address of the appropriate Etherlink kernel governance contract
- The address of the Etherlink Smart Rollup; the parameter must include the double quotes

After the new kernel becomes active, bakers must provide their nodes with the preimages for the new kernel to continue to participate in Etherlink.
They can copy the new preimages into the node data directory without stopping or restarting the node.
If a node uses a preimages endpoint as described in [Running an Etherlink EVM node](/network/evm-nodes) and [Running an Etherlink Smart Rollup node](/network/smart-rollup-nodes), the node updates automatically.

## Participating in sequencer governance

Bakers can propose the account to operate Etherlink's sequencer, vote for or against proposed operators, and trigger the change to a new account.

### Getting information about the current period

You can get information about the current period at https://governance.etherlink.com.

To get information about the current state of the sequencer operator governance contract directly from the contract, call its `get_voting_state` view.
For example, this Octez client command calls this view for the kernel governance contract on Mainnet:

```bash
octez-client  -E https://mainnet.ecadinfra.com \
  run view get_voting_state on contract KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf
```

The view returns information about the current governance period.
Block explorers show this information in a more human-readable format.

You can also subscribe to the `voting_finished` event to be notified when the Proposal period completes.

### Proposing and voting for a new operator

To propose an account to be the sequencer operator, bakers can call the `new_proposal` entrypoint of the governance contract during the Proposal period:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf \
  --entrypoint "new_proposal" \
  --arg "Pair \"<PUBLIC_KEY>\" <L2_ADDRESS>"
```

The command takes these parameters:

- The address or Octez client alias of your baker account or the account to which you have delegated your Etherlink voting rights
- The address of the sequencer governance contract (referred to on the block explorer as the sequencer committee governance contract)
- The public key (not the public key hash or account address) of the account to propose, including the double quotes, represented in this example as `<PUBLIC_KEY>`
- The Etherlink address of the account to propose, represented in this example as `<L2_ADDRESS>`

For example:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf \
  --entrypoint "new_proposal" \
  --arg 'Pair "<PUBLIC_KEY>" <L2_ADDRESS>'
```

To upvote a proposed sequencer operator during a Proposal period, call the `upvote_proposal` entrypoint with the same parameters:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf \
  --entrypoint "upvote_proposal" \
  --arg 'Pair "<PUBLIC_KEY>" <L2_ADDRESS>'
```

It's not necessary to upvote a proposal that you submitted; submitting a proposal implies that your account upvotes it.

### Voting for or against an operator

When a proposal is in the Promotion period, you can vote for or against it or pass on voting by calling the `vote` entrypoint of the governance contract:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf \
  --entrypoint "vote" --arg '"yea"'
```

The command takes these parameters:

- The address or Octez client alias of your baker account or the account to which you have delegated your Etherlink voting rights
- The address of the sequencer governance contract
- `"yea"`, `"nay"`, or `"pass"`, including the double quotes

For example:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from tz1RLPEeMxbJYQBFbXYw8WHdXjeUjnG5ZXNq to KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf \
  --entrypoint "vote" --arg "\"yea\""
```

### Triggering sequencer operator updates

After a proposed account wins a vote, any user can trigger the change and enable that account to run the sequencer by calling the governance contract's `trigger_committee_upgrade` entrypoint:

```bash
octez-client transfer 0 from my_wallet to KT1WckZ2uiLfHCfQyNp1mtqeRcC1X6Jg2Qzf \
  --entrypoint "trigger_committee_upgrade" \
  --arg '"sr1Ghq66tYK9y3r8CC1Tf8i8m5nxh8nTvZEf"'
```

The command takes these parameters:

- The address or Octez client alias of your account
- The address of the sequencer governance contract
- The address of the Etherlink Smart Rollup; the parameter must include the double quotes
