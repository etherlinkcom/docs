## Tezos Unity SDK

The [Tezos Unity SDK](https://docs.tezos.com/unity) provides tools that lets you access Etherlink in games and other Unity applications.
You can use the SDK to:

- Use a player's account as their account for a game and their wallet as their way of logging in to the game
- Accept payments from players in XTZ
- Use Etherlink to create game assets, store player inventories, and transfer assets between players
- Verify that users own specific game assets and allow them to transfer them to other players
- Use smart contracts as backend logic for games

The SDK supports wallets that connect via the WalletConnect protocol, including MetaMask.
It can call Etherlink contracts and initiate transfers of XTZ on Etherlink.

Using Etherlink in a Unity application requires version 4.0.0 of the Tezos Unity SDK or later.
For more information, see the documentation for the [Tezos Unity SDK](https://docs.tezos.com/unity).
