The [Tezos Unity SDK](https://docs.tezos.com/unity) provides tools that lets you access Etherlink in games and other Unity applications.
You can use the SDK to:

- Use a player's account as their account for a game and their wallet as their way of logging in to the game
- Accept payments from players in XTZ
- Use Etherlink to create game assets, store player inventories, and transfer assets between players
- Verify that users own specific game assets and allow them to transfer them to other players
- Use smart contracts as backend logic for games

The SDK supports wallets that connect via the WalletConnect protocol, including MetaMask.

Using Etherlink in a Unity application requires version 4.0.0 of the Tezos Unity SDK or later.
For more information, see the documentation for the [Tezos Unity SDK](https://docs.tezos.com/unity).
