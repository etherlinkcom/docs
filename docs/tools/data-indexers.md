## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible with GraphQL. Etherlink dApps can use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network.

For information on indexing contracts with The Graph, see [Indexing Etherlink contracts with TheGraph](/building-on-etherlink/indexing-graph).

## Subsquid

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) is a peer-to-peer network to quickly batch, query and aggregate on-chain and off-chain data.

Learn how to use their SDK with this [guide](https://docs.subsquid.io/sdk/how-to-start/).

## DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io) provides a framework for creating custom indexers.

For information on indexing Etherlink with DipDup, see [Etherlink](https://dipdup.io/docs/supported-networks/etherlink) in the DipDup documentation.

## Subquery

[Subquery indexer](https://www.subquery.network/indexer) is an open-source indexer that supports Etherlink, along with many other networks.

For examples of using Subquery with Etherlink, see these sample projects:

- Mainnet: https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/Etherlink%20Mainnet/etherlink-mainnet-etherlink-starter
- Testnet: https://github.com/subquery/ethereum-subql-starter/tree/main/Etherlink/etherlink-testnet-starter

## Goldsky

[Goldsky](https://goldsky.com/) hosts subgraphs with information about Etherlink.
