## The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for organizing blockchain data and making it easily accessible with GraphQL. Etherlink dApps can use GraphQL to query open APIs called subgraphs, to retrieve data that is indexed on the network.

Learn how to create and deploy your own subgraph in this [guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/quick-start/), and find more about querying existing subgraphs [here](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/querying-the-graph/).

## Subsquid

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) is a peer-to-peer network to quickly batch, query and aggregate on-chain and off-chain data.

Learn how to use their SDK with this [guide](https://docs.subsquid.io/sdk/how-to-start/).
