On-ramps and off-ramps convert fiat currency to Etherlink tokens and back, which allows your users to use cryptocurrency on your site as seamlessly as they use fiat currency on traditional finance sites.
On-ramps and off-ramps can integrate with your application to allow it to:

- Use Etherlink as a payment method and financial backend
- Receive payments in Etherlink without requiring users to buy cryptocurrency manually
- Make it easier to bridge and swap cryptocurrency tokens

Some on-ramps and off-ramps also allow users to conduct transactions with their wallets directly, without using a specific dApp.

These on-ramps/off-ramps support Etherlink:
