title: 'ðŸ¤” Why use Etherlink?'

### It's fast

Tezos's 2-block finality guarantee and the speed of its Smart Rollups ensure that transactions are finalized quickly.
Leveraging the latest research with a modified implementation of [Bullshark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05677) with [Shoal](https://medium.com/aptoslabs/shoal-how-we-reduce-bullshark-latency-on-the-aptos-blockchain-44a600d977a1), Etherlink is low latency, with sub-second confirmation times:

<table><thead><tr><th width="170">Chain</th><th width="141.33333333333331">Sequencer</th><th>L2 finality time</th><th>Data posted on L1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Etherlink</td><td>Decentralized</td><td>~ 750ms</td><td>~ 15 seconds</td></tr><tr><td>Optimism Bedrock</td><td>Centralized</td><td>~ <a href="https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#blocks">2 seconds</a></td><td>~ <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/batches">2 minutes</a></td></tr><tr><td>Arbitrum One</td><td>Centralized</td><td>~ <a href="https://arbiscan.io/">300ms</a></td><td>~ <a href="https://arbiscan.io/batches">7 minutes</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

### It's decentralized

Etherlink's decentralized sequencer provides high availability and resistance to attacks.
If the sequencing fails, users have an option to submit to the L1 directly after a delay.

### It's cheap

Etherlink is built on Tezos Smart Rollups, which are enshrined on the platform, meaning that they are implemented directly on layer 1 of the protocol.
However, because Smart Rollups run in their own separate environments, they are not subject to the per-transaction gas fees of layer 1, only small fees when they publish their state to layer 1.
At a load of 50TPS, you can expect an ERC-20 transaction to cost $0.01 or less on Etherlink.

Smart Rollups also provide standardized communication between layer 1 and other rollups, even those with different execution environments, such as EVM, Michelson, and SVM.
They can retrieve data from outside the Tezos blockchain via the reveal data channel.
