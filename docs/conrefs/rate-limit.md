:::note

The following examples use the public Etherlink RPC endpoints listed in [Network information](/get-started/network-information), which are rate-limited.
If you need to make requests in a production environment, run your own EVM node as described in [Running an Etherlink EVM node](/network/evm-nodes) and send the requests to it.
