## First kernel upgrade

The first upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 22 July 2024.
It includes updates and improvements to Etherlink's support for EVM endpoints to make calling Etherlink more similar to calling any other EVM network.

## Bifröst upgrade

The Bifröst upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 7 November 2024.
It adds support for bridging [FA tokens from Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens#token-standards) to ERC-20 tokens on Etherlink and support for the callTracer tracer, which makes it possible for third-party tools like the Blockscout block explorer to index Etherlink transactions.
