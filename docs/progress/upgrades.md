title: Kernel upgrades
---

This page lists the major updates to the Etherlink kernel.

## Mainnet beta

The Mainnet beta was the final step before launching Etherlink.
For more information, see [Etherlink Mainnet Beta: Paving the Way to Launch](https://medium.com/etherlink/etherlink-mainnet-beta-paving-the-way-to-launch-14606e29cc8b)

## First kernel upgrade

The first upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 22 July 2024.
It includes updates and improvements to Etherlink's support for EVM endpoints to make calling Etherlink more similar to calling any other EVM network.
For more information, see [The First Regular Upgrade for Etherlink: One Step Closer to Launch](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-first-regular-upgrade-for-etherlink-one-step-closer-to-launch-6176b2136eaf).

## Bifröst upgrade

The Bifröst upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 7 November 2024.
It adds support for bridging [FA tokens from Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens#token-standards) to ERC-20 tokens on Etherlink and support for the callTracer tracer, which makes it possible for third-party tools like the Blockscout block explorer to index Etherlink transactions.

## Calypso upgrade

<!--
TODO if promoted to Mainnet, update with the date of activation.
If rejected, change this section to say that it was proposed but not approved.
-->

The proposed Calypso upgrade to the Etherlink kernel was installed on Etherlink Testnet on TODO DATE.

This upgrade includes significant performance and reliability improvements, including:

- Up to 30x performance improvement for smart contract storage interactions
- Reduced disk footprint for Etherlink Smart Rollup nodes, which now store only the latest block in the Smart Rollup context; the full history remains available in Etherlink EVM nodes
- Caching in the virtual machine to improve read and write performance on storage indexes
- Updated governance contracts to align periods with Quebec changes in block time
- Events generated by the kernel to notify the sequencer of delayed transaction flushes, reducing downtime risks caused by unforeseen events

The upgrade also includes foundational work to the withdrawal precompiled contract that is a step toward allowing faster withdrawals from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1.
