title: Kernel upgrades

This page lists the major updates to the Etherlink kernel.

## Mainnet beta

The Mainnet beta was the final step before launching Etherlink.
For more information, see [Etherlink Mainnet Beta: Paving the Way to Launch](https://medium.com/etherlink/etherlink-mainnet-beta-paving-the-way-to-launch-14606e29cc8b)

## First kernel upgrade

The first upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 22 July 2024.
It includes updates and improvements to Etherlink's support for EVM endpoints to make calling Etherlink more similar to calling any other EVM network.
For more information, see [The First Regular Upgrade for Etherlink: One Step Closer to Launch](https://medium.com/etherlink/the-first-regular-upgrade-for-etherlink-one-step-closer-to-launch-6176b2136eaf).

## Bifröst upgrade

The Bifröst upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 7 November 2024.
It adds support for bridging [FA tokens from Tezos layer 1](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/tokens#token-standards) to ERC-20 tokens on Etherlink and support for the callTracer tracer, which makes it possible for third-party tools like the Blockscout block explorer to index Etherlink transactions and for applications to trace transactions as described in [Tracing transactions](/building-on-etherlink/transactions#tracing-transactions).

## Calypso upgrade

The proposed Calypso upgrade to the Etherlink kernel went live on Etherlink Mainnet on 4 March 2025.

This upgrade includes significant performance and reliability improvements, including:

- Caching in the virtual machine to improve read and write performance on storage indexes, leading to faster interaction with smart contracts
- Reduced disk footprint for Etherlink Smart Rollup nodes, which now store only the latest block in the Smart Rollup context; the full history remains available in Etherlink EVM nodes
- Updated governance contracts to align periods with Quebec changes in block time
- Events generated by the kernel to notify the sequencer of delayed transaction flushes, reducing downtime risks caused by unforeseen events

The upgrade also includes foundational work to the withdrawal precompiled contract that is a step toward allowing faster withdrawals from Etherlink to Tezos layer 1.

## Calypso2 upgrade

On 12 April 2025, the Calypso2 security upgrade went live on Etherlink Mainnet, in Etherlink block 10,453,254.
This upgrade improves error handling of FA bridging transactions, which hardens the Etherlink sequencer against potential DDOS attacks.
This upgrade includes only a [security patch](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/commit/9ab8acd92eb91c5aa2325fbb2c1794bc11aa1b68&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1744727209624752&usg=AOvVaw07zM1UuZjKJ4Teuo_L51Nl) for the Calypso kernel and no other changes.

This upgrade was carried out through Etherlink’s [security governance process](https://docs.etherlink.com/governance/how-is-etherlink-governed#security-governance).

For more information, see [Calypso2: A security upgrade to harden the Etherlink sequencer and FA bridge](https://research-development.nomadic-labs.com/etherlink-calypso2-upgrade.html).

## Dionysus upgrade

On 21 May 2025, the Dionysus kernel upgrade went live on Etherlink Mainnet, in Etherlink block 15,262,162.
This upgrade includes:

- Support for EVM version Cancun features
- Foundational work to allow faster withdrawals of FA tokens to Tezos layer 1
- Improvements to gas price computation logic to reduce the effect of price spikes
- The ability for the sequencer to publish blocks via the [Data Availability Layer](https://docs.tezos.com/architecture/data-availability-layer)
- Upgraded governance contracts to be compatible with the Tezos Rio upgrade

Running an Etherlink EVM node on Dionysus requires version 0.26 or later of the `octez-evm-node` binary.
